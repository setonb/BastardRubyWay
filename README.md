The Bastards Book of Ruby
A Programming Primer for Counting and Other Unconventional Tasks


These are the 33 chapters that I've so far started writing, divided into 4 sections. I've included a factbox for each chapter to indicate how complete it is.

• The Fundamentals • Supplementals • Design and Theory • The Projects

The Fundamentals section is probably best read chronologically. If you already know how to program, the Supplemental chapters and Projects cover a wide range of real-world use cases that might interest you.

Please read the About page for more details on the progress of this book.
